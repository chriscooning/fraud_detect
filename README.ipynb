    "Throughout this analysis, we explored several methods to detect anomalies. We leveraged traditional classification using a variety of models, we considered oversampling, and we found pretty inspiring results using supervised tree-based classifiers. Ultimately, we found for this business case that autoencoders, PCA and Neural Networks were very useful tools.\n",
